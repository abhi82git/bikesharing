# NYC CitiBike

## Overview
The purpose of the analysis is to understand better how CitiBike bikes are rented/utilized by customers in NYC, adn whether or not the bikes are being sufficiently utillized across diffierent days of week/times of day etc. This will help to understand if a similar program can be set up in Des Moines and other cities across the country.

The project will display the results in a Tableau story, thus givnig readers visual analysis of raw data from CitiBike.

## Results
Let's take a look at the analysis on the data and salient points.

### Checkout Time for users
The chart below shows the duration for which bikes were checked out. The largest number of bikes were rented for 5 minutes, and the long tail indicates that more bikes were rented for more than 5 mintes, than for less than 5 minutes.

### Checkout Times by Gender
This chart breaks down the previous one into genders. While 5/6 minutes, is still the the timeslot for maximum number of bikes - it is evident that not only men rented more bikes, they also rented them for longer duration than other genders.

### Trips By Weekday per hour
This is a heatmap showing what days of the week and what times of the day are most bikes being rented/used. From the chart it is clear, that most bike are rented between 7 AM to 6 PM on weekdays (barring the evening on Fridays, probaly due to the oncoming weekend party/trips/recreation).

### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)
This heatmap further breaks down the previous heatmap by genders. While the peak days/times remain same as the previous heatmap, this ocnfirms the prevous conclusion that men rent much much more than other genders.

## Summary
To summarize, following are the main points from the analysis:
 - Subscribers use more bikes than customers.
 - Weekdays are busier than weekends - most likely because subscribers use bikes more on weekdays and tourist are the more common users on weekends.
 - Men ride much much more than other genders
 - Evenig hours are the busiest, followed by early morning hours.

Two visualizations that would help in gleaning more insight from the data could be:
 - Distance covered on each ride. This would help in understanding if customers are ok with riding bikes for moderate distances, or are they looking for bikes for shorter - a bloc or two - routes.
 - Reasons behind the disparity between men and women renting bikes. This could be a huge growth opportunity among female customers.
